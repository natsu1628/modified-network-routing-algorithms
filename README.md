# modified-network-routing-algorithms
This repo contains the implementation of modified versions of network routing algorithms to solve the MAX-BANDWIDTH-PATH problem. 
The algorithms implemented consists of - 
1. Modified Dijkstra's algorithm without using heap data structure
2. Modified Dijkstra's algorithm using the heap data structure
3. Modified Kruskal's algorithm usig HeapSort
